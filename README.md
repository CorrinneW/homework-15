# Professional Portfolio
Updated web development portfolio.

## The Goal
A landing page that showcases recent projects, provides a bio & contact information, and allows a user to download a resume.

## What I Did
1. Used a combination of Pure.css, Bulma and custome CSS to build an attractive, user friendly interface.
2. Used a small amount of Javascript to power a responsive collapsible navigation menu.
3. Added my own animation to the header and CSS transitions to buttons to create a fun user experience.

## The Result

A simple but personalized site that is as much a part of my portfolio as the projects it showcases.
